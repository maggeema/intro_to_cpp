2-D arrays: you'll need to initialize a capacity for both your rows and columns 
    ie:
    const int COUNTRIES = 8;
    const int MEDALS = 3;
    int arr[COUNTRIES][MEDALS];

Just as with one dimensional arrays, you cannot change the size of 2-D array once it has 
been defined.

TO address individual elements, you need to address speicific locations in terms of 
vertical and horizontal elements.
