Notes: February 1, 2023

NOTE: when a string is read with the >> operator, only one word is placed into the string
variable. 
    ie: (the input "HARRY POTTER" is typed, but only HARRY is cin'ed)
.length() takes a variable parameter
.substr() takes a starting index and the number of indices after the starting index as 
    parameters
String literal means anything in double quotes (includes "", " ", or even just a char "A")
Rule of thumb: the first variable of a concatination must be a variable name and not a 
    string literal
    ie: 
    string str = "C" + "++";
    // this leads to an error
range functions are used most often; takes in up to three parameters (if there's more than 
    that, it'll give ou an error "function overload")
Unicode: another way to represent characters

array: to initialize an array, the format should be (data type) (variable name) (array size)
    ie: 
    int numbers [10];
