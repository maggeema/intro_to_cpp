indentifers: what we call variable names or function names
one equal sign is an assignment operator, whereas two equal signs is a boolean
constants (const): a variable that cannot be changed and must be set when created 
    ie:
    const double BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2;
    // this means that this variable BOTTLE_VOLUME is always going to be 2
    // in good practice, consts are always capitalized to distinguish them from regular vars

a good reason to use constants:
    ie:
    double volume = bottles * 2;
    // can be rewritten as:
    const double BOTTLE_VOLUME = 2;    
    double volume = bottles * BOTTLE_VOLUME;

usually is better to use doubles instead of floats because doubles have 8 bytes of storage
whereas floats only have 4 bytes of storage
